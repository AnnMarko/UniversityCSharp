# Console Cat Drawing Program 🐱

This C# console application draws a cat in a step-by-step manner at a user-defined position. It follows an object-oriented approach, with separate classes handling different parts of the cat. The program includes functionalities such as:

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Draws a cat** in the console using separate elements.
- 📍 **Custom positioning** — users can specify where the cat appears.
- ⏳ **Adjustable drawing speed** — set a delay for step-by-step rendering.
- 🐾 **Modular structure** — each part of the cat (head, ears, tail, etc.) is implemented as a separate class.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- 🔹 **C# (.NET)**
- 🔹 **Console Application**
- 🔹 **OOP (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)**

## 📂 Project Overview
The program consists of several classes, each responsible for a specific part of the cat:
- **Cat.cs** — assembles all elements and calls their drawing methods.
- **Head.cs** — the cat's head.
- **Ears.cs** — the ears.
- **Paws.cs** — the paws.
- **Tail.cs** — the tail.
- **Accessory.cs** — a collar.
