# 3D Point Management Program 🖥️

This simple program helps to manage points in 3D space. It allows users to create, move, and analyze points using various mathematical operations. The program includes functionalities such as:

## ✨ Features
- 📌 **Creating points** with user-defined coordinates or default values.
- 📏 **Calculating distances** to the origin and between two points.
- 🔄 **Converting Cartesian coordinates** to spherical coordinates.
- 🔍 **Finding symmetrical points** relative to coordinate planes and axes.
- 🚀 **Moving points** along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- 💾 **Saving and loading points** from a JSON file for persistence.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- 🔹 **C# (.NET)**
- 🔹 **Console Application**
- 🔹 **JSON Serialization**

## 📂 Project Overview
This is a university project demonstrating:
- **OOP principles** (encapsulation, constructors, and properties).
- **File handling** (reading and writing JSON data).
- **Mathematical operations** in 3D space.
