3D Point Management Program 🖥️
This simple program helps to manage points in 3D space. It allows users to create, move, and analyze points using various mathematical operations. The program includes functionalities such as:

Creating points with user-defined coordinates or default values.
Calculating distances to the origin and between two points.
Converting Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates.
Finding symmetrical points relative to coordinate planes and axes.
Moving points along the X, Y, and Z axes.
Saving and loading points from a JSON file for persistence.
💾 Technologies Used:
C# (.NET)
Console Application
JSON Serialization
This is a university project demonstrating OOP principles, file handling, and basic mathematical operations in 3D space. 🚀
